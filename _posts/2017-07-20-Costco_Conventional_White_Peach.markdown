<b>tl,dr: Costco Conventional White Peach; Sweetness = sweet, Juiciness = juicy; Recommend = Yes</b>

Some fruit dream. They sit, slumbering on their vines, awaiting a life as the lead member of a crumble or a tart,
as the star of some summer salad, or the prize winning peach at this year's state fair.

Those aren't Costco fruit.

Costco fruit sleep sterile, dreamless sleeps. If they do think at night, it's about packing efficiency, the automatic doors of
late model minivans, or how their blemishes look under fluorescent light.

Or so I thought.

My beliefs changed recently when my colleague
Mr. Tim (who readers know from <a href="/The_Center_Cannot_Hold.html">this post</a>), gifted me with a conventionally
grown, California white peach from Costco.

It sat on my desk for a few days, biding its time as I tended to other fruit. But then it was ripe, and I was going
out of town. So in a harried act of fruit consumption, I devoured this peach in the parking lot of the
 Charlottesville Albermarle Airport.

 As you can see, I was not disappointed:

|Juicy|Sweet|Price|Recommend|
|--- |---|---|---|---|
|4, Very Juicy|2, Sweet|???|Yes|


This was a good peach. Not a rockstar peach, or even an amazing peach, but a peach that I can confidently
recommend. Learn from my prejudice folk -- don't knock it till you try it.

But that was before I came to work one day and met a certain, unassuming peach. It was white, conventionally grown, and sitting
unassumingly on a paper napkin on my desk. Beneath it, scrawled in blue ink, was a single word -- Costco.


But as I eat my fruit, I'm not too big to eat my words. And a recent fruit gift by my dear colleague Mr. Tim has brought about a
change of mind.

There I was, standing in the Charlottesville Albermarle Airport on a Thursday afternoon, eating -- with equal parts surprise
 and enjoyment -- a conventional, California grown, Costco white peach.

 After so many stone fruit, of higher birth, failing to live up to their vaulted pedigree, here I met a fruit of juiciness level "very juicy"
  and sweetness level "sweet"



A freshly plucked peach from the sun kissed branches of Chiles orchard? Yes, please. Or a just ripe tomatoe from a colleague's garden? Por que no?
But a peach from Costco? Is it about a store like that

Costco fruit are born out of convenience, cost cutting, and cold corporate accounting. They don't dream but sit unconsciouly, They are the forgotten, urban youth of America's inner cities. They don't dream -- they merely sleep. The await a short,
life of mediocrity and mindless consumption. They get gunned down walking to school (what?).

The fruit at Costco are the

result of bulk, convenience and cold corporate accounting,

Costco is a behemoth of bulk and convenience, of loveless, commodified products that should taste more like fossil fuels
and the wood in corporate board rooms than a well loved, farm raised piece of prdouce.


, that shouldn't produce anything that doesn't require ketchup

 paneled board rooms than quality produce. They should be mediocre.

maybe just as the juice in some yuppie gym. What that is to be enjoyed.


or just being enjoyed alone, dripping down the cheeks of some sun

waiting for the day when they are


held in the hands
of some sweet child, racing from car to kitchen to be washed, and cut, and baked in a pie



and baked in a delicious gallete.
To be enjoyed amongst good friends, good wine,


You should not be reading about this peach.


It should have lived a life of mediocrity in the Costco produce section,
or dropped and squashed

 died in the uncaring florescent light of the Costco
produce section

 wasn't meant for  was not meant to be should not have been liked. It's from Costco, first of all, a behemoth of bulk and
convenience that I sooner associate with

sun swept parking lots and suburban sprawl than sweet and
 sumptous stone fruit.

I wasn't planning on like this peach. It's from Costco, a behemoth of bulk and convenience that I
don't associate with high quality. No offence meant, loyal Costco customers -- I am just
a prejudiced yuppie from the burbs with a nose aimed so high in the air it's a miracle I noticed
this peach at all.

But I did notice it -- sitting there meekly on my desk at work, on a crumpled napkin with the word "Costco"
scrawled beneath it in blue ink.

Since I've started this blog, and started talking non-stop about it at work, and involving
my colleagues in various fruit tastings, some of my coworkers have indulged my
newly found passion with gifts of fruit left at my desk. Like some exotic king of yore, returning to
his throne in the morning to find the day's tribute ... well that's about where the similarity
stops.

Anyway, friend of the blog Mr. Tim, who appeared in <a href="">this post</a>, gifted me a peach
for a review. Mr. Tim is a family man, and so the bulk offerings of a giant like costco
probably suits his needs more so than a man whose children are blog posts.
