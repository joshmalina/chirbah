<b>tl,dr: Whole Foods lets you try before you buy — take advantage</b>

There is a simple way to solve the fruit asymmetry problem — just eat before you buy. At most grocery stores, this is illegal — which we can't condone at chirbah.

Fortunately, at Whole Foods, we aren't made to be criminals in our pursuit of sweet fruit — just curious, welcome customers. Twice now, in Charlottesville and Chicago, I tried fruit before buying and was much better off for it.

In Chicago, I avoided a not-so-sweet watermelon, and instead came away with a great Santa Claus Melon.

| Sweetness | Juiciness  | Price        | Recommend |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Sweet     | Very Juicy | $4.99 / each | Yes       |

Do any of your local grocery stores / markets let you try the fruit before you eat it? Let me know in the comments.
