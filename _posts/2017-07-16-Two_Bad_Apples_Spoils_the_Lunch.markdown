When Eve ate from the tree of knowledge, I know that she saw the world differently. But did she
figure out how an apple should taste?

Well, if the Garden of Even were located at the Whole Foods on 29, I wouldn't hold out hope.
The conventionally grown, New Zealand Fuji and Gala apples are underwhelming at best, and tasteless at worst.

Now, readers of this blog will know that I like WF. Indeed, I endorse their stone
fruit. But their apple game is weak.

### Whole Foods Conventional Fuji -- New Zealand ($1.78/lb)

I ate this first, immediately after buying it. I'm willing to concede that it could
 have been riper. But how do you gauge the ripeness of a perfect looking apple? If you have
 any idea, please let me know in the comments.
 The texture was great -- very crispy, and the juice levels were appropriate.
 But it was just barely sweet.

|Fuji|$1.78 / lb|Faintly Sweet|Juicy|Crisp|No|

I can't recommend this apple because I refuse to believe that it's the best we can do. But, if
 you're satisfied with a good crunch, and a decent amount of juicy, then this isn't a terrible
 purchase -- especially at $1.78 / lb.


### Whole Foods Conventional Royal Gala -- New Zealand ($1.78/lb)

This was a pretty apple. It shined. It felt good in my hand. It looked like an apple you'd give
 a prize winning pig. And maybe he'd like it.

 But I didn't.

 Despite its looks, it tasted like water, and was in fact a little mealy. Don't buy
  this apple, people. In a world with so much good fruit,
  this was a waste of an appetite.

<!-- notes

This was a bad apple. I ate it three days after purchasing, and it was very pretty.
Good sheen, good weight, good shape -- pretty little stem.

Looks like it's gonna be good. Didn't taste like anything.

It's a little mealy, but not terribly so.

It's not sweet.

Waste of an appetite.

It's not really good. I don't know if it's good. I don't think it's good.

It sucks. Tastes like water. It has no flavour.
